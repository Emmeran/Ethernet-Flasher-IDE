Ethernet-Flasher-IDE
====================

IDE for Arduino based AVR code for uploading via avrdude or Ethernet Flasher

Note: the EthernetFlasher does not work at the moment but will be added later on.

Description
====================
This IDE compiles your project together with the Arduino core (please make sure to set the paths in the build settings).
You can upload your code via avrdude and via the Ethernet Flasher for W5100 based Ethernet-enabled Arduinos.

For that to work you need to burn the EthernetBootloader to your device.
